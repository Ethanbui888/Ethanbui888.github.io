### CPSC 120

* Lab 1, part 1
    Lab 1, part 1 was the lab where I got to test the waters a little. I got to play around with the "/* word */" for the header. While I did originally lose points, this was the point where I began to better understand the assignments we would be given.
* Lab 4, part 1
    Lab 4, part 1 was the introduction to multi-file assignments. These would be my favorite types of assignments as it was incredibly simple. It was write the base functions in main.cc -> write the supporting functions in functions.cc -> debug and submit. However, the best part of this assignment was that it used the same types of code that was easy to understand, like equations or bool.
* Lab 6, part 2
    Lab 10, part 2 was a lab primarily about reading an input for blackjack. This was one of my favorite labs because it was so much easier than most of the other labs to test a more point by point solution. It was one of the labs I was able to do solo due to this.
